# The_Boredless_Tourist
Codecademy Python Project

The purpose of this project is make a program that given the name, location of travel, and interests of a person, will return attractions that they might like to visit. Most of the explanations behind the code can be found in the comments of the program itself. During this project I used git, which is why some steps are missing in the comments. This is where I was using git in the background.
